/*
Inference Example Notes:
- For speed, you would want to convert these weights to i16s, as for
    this specific architecture they won't cause any overflow issues.
- ReLU and CReLU do not introduce the additional quantisation factor
    that SCReLU does.
- `QA = 181` to utilise an additional trick with manual SIMD, not included
    here and the compiler will not be able to do it automatically.

This is how you would load the network in rust.
Commented out because it will error if it can't find the file.
static NNUE: Network =
    unsafe { std::mem::transmute(*include_bytes!("../resources/net-epoch30.bin")) };
